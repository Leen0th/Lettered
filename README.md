# Lettered Project

## Introduction
Hi! 👋 I am thrilled to introduce **Lettered**, a multiplayer game that allows players to connect and compete in real-time. **Lettered** project consists of both the server and client components. The server manages player connections, game logic, and broadcasts game updates to connected clients. The client is responsible for handling user interactions, displaying real-time updates, and maintaining communication with the server. This project demonstrates server-client communication using Java Sockets, multithreading, and real-time game management.

## About the Project

### What it Does
- **Server Component**: The server listens for incoming client connections, handles player interactions, and manages game events. It broadcasts updates (game results, player lists, etc.) to all connected clients.
- **Client Component**: The client connects to the server, sends player actions, and receives updates (game results, player notifications, etc.) in real-time. It provides a user interface to interact with the game.
- **Multithreading**: The server uses threads to handle multiple clients simultaneously, ensuring smooth gameplay and communication.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Players are notified immediately about game outcomes (winners, losers) and new player connections.

### Features
- **🔗 Player Connectivity**  
  Seamless connection and disconnection of players in real-time.

- **🏆 Game Results**  
  Dynamic announcements for game outcomes, including winners and losers.

- **🎮 Real-Time Communication**  
  Continuous server communication to keep players updated on game events.

- **🔔 Notifications**  
  Display notifications for new players and game-related events.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Java Swing (for client-side user interface)
- **Backend**: Java Sockets (for client-server communication)
- **Multithreading**: For handling multiple client connections simultaneously
- **Networking**: TCP/IP communication for client-server interaction
